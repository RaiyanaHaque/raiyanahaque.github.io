            <h3>PROJECT: Nova</h3>
            <p>PROJECT: Nova is 2D top down boss rush game set in a dystopian cyberpunk world where the player (Nova) has to reach the top floor to save her sister, captured by an evil organisation. The game includes puzzle mechanics as well as shooting down enemies. The game is topped off by a boss level at the end. The game has been influenced by different sources such as movies and other video games. It was heavily inspired by futuristic movies such as Ultra Violet, Ghost in The Shell and more. Gameplay mechanics were examples from Enter the Gungeon, Transistor and Invisible Inc. Art style was a merge between pixel and semi-realistic art but it was mainly influenced by the GameBoy Pokemon games. <p class = "para">PROJECT: Nova isnâ€™t just about fighting enemies and solving puzzles but also includes narrative elements to add depth to the story which some retro, shooter games lack as they are only focusing on the action. The objective was to connect the players with the characters in the game. This game was made for the Final Major Project for Year 12 with a team of four. I was the games director and I had three other team members who were the programmer, artist and sound engineer. I have mostly done the programming elements of this game including the player controller, shooting mechanic and creating the UI and HUD in C#. </p>
