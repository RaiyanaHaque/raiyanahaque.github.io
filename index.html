        <img class = "a-banner" src="a-img.png">
        <p class = "about-p"> Hi! I am a Year 13 games design student at East London Arts and Music (ELAM). I am aspiring to be an AI programmer in the future. Currently, I am learning C# and C++ as a few bits of Java and other programming languages but my main focus in on the first two. I am making games at college; some are independent and others are group projects. Plus, I am also working on some personal projects outside of college. I am also doing Maths and English alongside. On the course, I am not only learning about programming but also narrative and storytelling, sound recording and editing, art and creating assets. I am learning evert aspect of games development pipeline. I also have experience with 3D modelling and I am improving at using Unity and Unreal.</p>

          <h3>PROJECT: Nova</h3>
          <p>PROJECT: Nova is 2D top down boss rush game set in a dystopian cyberpunk world where the player (Nova) has to reach the top floor to save her sister, captured by an evil organisation. The game includes puzzle mechanics as well as shooting down enemies. The game is topped off by a boss level at the end. The game has been influenced by different sources such as movies and other video games. It was heavily inspired by futuristic movies such as Ultra Violet, Ghost in The Shell and more. Gameplay mechanics were examples from Enter the Gungeon, Transistor and Invisible Inc. Art style was a merge between pixel and semi-realistic art but it was mainly influenced by the GameBoy Pokemon games. <p>PROJECT: Nova isn’t just about fighting enemies and solving puzzles but also includes narrative elements to add depth to the story which some retro, shooter games lack as they are only focusing on the action. The objective was to connect the players with the characters in the game. This game was made for the Final Major Project for Year 12 with a team of four. I was the games director and I had three other team members who were the programmer, artist and sound engineer. I have mostly done the programming elements of this game including the player controller, shooting mechanic and creating the UI and HUD in C#. </p>

          <h3> The Lazarus Murder</h3>
          <p>The Lazarus Murder is a 3D first person horror game where the player explores a house to find out clues about a murder that happened a few years ago. The player plays as a journalist who has been requested to explore the crime scene of a closed down case about a murder of an orphan girl. Due to the police not finding any clues, the case was dismissed. But it is opened again and the player finds that there is more to the murder; something supernatural. </p>
          <li>The game was an independent project – the game is not completely finished yet but has an end game after the player has reached the last room in the house.</li>
          <li>Made with Unreal Engine and visual blueprinting. </li>
          <li>3D modelling done by using Maya and texturing done with Mudbox and Photoshop. </li>
          <li>The game was intended to be played with VR but it mainly works well on the computer.</li>

          <h3>Cooper's Course</h3>
          <p>Cooper’s Course is a game jam project with a team of four. I played the part of the programmer. The game jam was judged by people from Creative Assembly, Machinima XBOC and Sports Interactive. This was my first game jam and it was very good experience. The game is a platformer featuring a dog who is running through a winter forest to get to its owner.</p>
          <li>The game has a unique art style of watercolour textures.</li>
          <li>It was created in Unity, C#.</li>
          <li>I did all the programming for the game and one of the interesting mechanic is that the dog has to move crates to jump to the next platform. The game is not completed and has no proper end game but it is playable!</li>

          <h3>Arcane Messenger</h3>
          <p>Arcane Messenger is an endless runner game where the player plays as a girl who is on a mission to get a wizard who can potentially save her village from destruction and she was chosen as the arcane messenger to carry out this objective. </p>
          <li>This was an independent project.</li>
          <li>Done in Unity, C#.</li>
          <li>Other softwares used: Photoshop and aesprite.</li>
          <li>For this project, I tried to implement a shop system and an add revenue system for the game but was not able to finish it. </li>

          <h3>Sugar Ball!</h3>
          <p>Sugar Ball is the first game that I have ever made. This is a simple 3D roller ball game with the objective of getting all of the sugar cubes to finish the game (I did not have any other idea at that moment). The game has a pastel colour scheme and looks quite cute compared to the newer and recent games that I have made. This game gave me the basic skill in Unity as well as pixel art and it started off my journey in C#! Although the game still has major bugs where the killbox does not work but it is still fun to play and make sure not to fall down.</p>
