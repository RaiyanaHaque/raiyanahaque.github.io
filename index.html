                    <img src="img/me.png" alt="" />

                    <p>I am a second year Games Programming student at Teesside University. Before that I started my journey into the games industry, when I attended East London Arts and Music for a 2 year Games Design course where I learned bits of programming, art, narrative and even sound design. I felt more comfortable in the realms of code and decided to accept my quest to become a better programmer.</p>

                    <p>I moved to the UK in 2015, and since then I had an idea that I wanted to be a part of the Games Industry (aka I wanted my name in the credits of a big game). Outside of the lands of university and education, I intern at Sports Interactive during the holidays, working on different things and not only just programming. This is where the 2 years of the Games Design course comes handy. I am also a mentee at Limit Break.</p>

                    <p>I am still exploring which department of programming I want to specialize in but I have my eyes on UI Programming and Network/Multiplayer Programming. (Let's add in Technical Artist as well).</p>
