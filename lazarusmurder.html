            <h3> The Lazarus Murder</h3>
            <p>The Lazarus Murder is a 3D first person horror game where the player explores a house to find out clues about a murder that happened a few years ago. The player plays as a journalist who has been requested to explore the crime scene of a closed down case about a murder of an orphan girl. Due to the police not finding any clues, the case was dismissed. But it is opened again and the player finds that there is more to the murder; something supernatural. </p>
            <li>The game was an independent project â€“ the game is not completely finished yet but has an end game after the player has reached the last room in the house.</li>
            <li>Made with Unreal Engine and visual blueprinting. </li>
            <li>3D modelling done by using Maya and texturing done with Mudbox and Photoshop. </li>
            <li>The game was intended to be played with VR but it mainly works well on the computer.</li>
            <li> Grade achieved: Merit</li>
